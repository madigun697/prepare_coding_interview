### Questions for BFS vs. DFS

#### If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
    - BFS is better
	- BFS searches the closest node from the root first

#### If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
    - BFS is better
	- DFS will take longer time

#### If the tree is very wide:
    - DFS is better
	- BFS will need too much memory

#### If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
    - DFS is better

#### Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
    - DFS

#### Finding the shortest path:
    - BFS
